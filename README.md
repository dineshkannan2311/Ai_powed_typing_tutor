ABSTRACT:

In today's digital world, typing proficiency is a critical asset in academic, professional, and personal domains. However, traditional typing tutors often fail to address individual user needs, leading to inefficiencies in learning. The AI-Powered Typing Tutor project aims to overcome this limitation by developing an adaptive learning system that personalizes typing instruction. By leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a form of recurrent neural network, the system analyzes user performance in real-time, adjusting exercises to target specific weaknesses.

The methodology involves collecting and analyzing typing data to identify common error patterns and inefficiencies unique to each user. Based on this data, the system dynamically adjusts the difficulty of exercises to enhance learning efficiency. The LSTM model is trained on a diverse dataset of typing patterns to predict errors and improve user accuracy.

This innovative system provides real-time feedback, evolving with user progress to optimize learning. The AI-Powered Typing Tutor is expected to significantly improve typing accuracy, speed, and user confidence. Future expansions could include multilingual support and features for individuals with learning difficulties, increasing the system's accessibility and impact in the educational technology field.
